Some of the computers can record infor-mation during normal driving if they detect anerror. In addition, information is recorded in theevent of a crash or incident. Parts of the recor-ded information are required so that techni-cians can diagnose and rectify faults in thevehicle during servicing and maintenance andso that Volvo can fulfil legal requirements andother regulations.

Inmany cases the exhaust emissions are wellbelow the applicable standards.Clean air in the passenger compartmentA passenger compartment filter prevents dustand pollen from entering the passenger com-partment via the air intake.A sophisticated air quality system, IAQS* (Inte-rior Air Quality System) ensures that the incom-ing air is cleaner than the air in the traffic out-side.The system consists of an electronic sensorand a carbon filter.

In this way you contribute to acleaner environment. When Volvo's workshopsare entrusted with the service and mainte-nance of your car it becomes part of our sys-tem. We make clear demands regarding theway in which our workshops are designed inorder to prevent spills and discharges into theenvironment. Our workshop staff have theknowledge and the tools required to guaranteegood environmental care.Reducing environmental impactYou can easily help reduce environmentalimpact - here are a few tips:•Avoid letting the engine idle - switch off theengine when stationary for longer periods.Pay attention to local regulations.•Drive economically - think ahead.•Perform service and maintenance inaccordance with the owner's manual'sinstructions - follow the Service and War-ranty Booklet's recommended intervals.•If the car is equipped with an engine blockheater*, use it before starting from cold - itimproves starting capacity and reduceswear in cold weather and the engine rea-ches normal operating temperature morequickly, which lowers consumption andreduces emissions.•High speed increases consumption con-siderably due to increased wind resistance- a doubling of speed increases wind resis-tance 4 times.•Always dispose of environmentally hazar-dous waste, such as batteries and oils, inan environmentally safe manner. Consult aworkshop in the event of uncertainty abouthow this type of waste should be discarded- an authorised Volvo workshop is recom-mended.Following this advice can save money, theplanet's resources are saved, and the car'sdurability is extended. For more informationand further advice, see the pages 142 and295.RecyclingAs a part of Volvo's environmental work, it isimportant that the car is recycled in an envi-ronmentally sound manner.

Theexperience is that the engine has been runningthe whole time but with an extremely quiet andlow idling speed.The Start/Stop function gives the driver theopportunity for a more active environmentallyconscious driving style by means of being ableto disengage gear and letting the engine auto-stop, whenever appropriate.Smart chargingThe car's kinetic energy is used during enginebraking by means of it being converted intoelectricity and stored in the car's battery.Adapted power steeringAnother DRIVe function is that the power steer-ing's energy take-off is adapted according torequirements. By means of optimisation andthe introduction of an energy saving functionthe energy take-off can be minimised on occa-sions where power assistance (help in turningthe steering wheel) is not necessary.AerodynamicsThe DRIVe concept also includes a loweredchassis, front and rear spoilers with low windresistance, as well as specially developedwheel rims1.\",\n",

       " {'text': \"195The reason for this is that tyres age and decom-pose, even if they are hardly ever or never used.The function can therefore be affected due tothe tyre's constituent materials being brokendown. In such a case the tyre should then notbe used. This also applies to spare tyres, wintertyres and tyres saved for future use. Examplesof external signs which indicate that the tyre isunsuitable for use are cracks or discoloration.The age of the tyre can be determined by theDOT marking, see previous illustration.More even wear and maintenanceThe correct tyre pressure results in more evenwear, see page 198. Driving style, tyre pres-sure, climate and road condition affect howquickly your tyres age and wear. To avoid dif-ferences in tread depth and to prevent wearpatterns arising, the front and rear wheels canbe switched with each other. A suitable dis-tance for the first change is approx. 5000 kmand then at 10 000 km intervals. Volvo recom-mends that you contact an authorised Volvoworkshop for checking if you are uncertainabout tread depth. If significant differences inwear (>1 mm difference in tread depth)between tyres have already occurred, the leastworn tyres must always be placed on the rear.Understeer is normally easier to correct thanoversteer, and leads to the car continuing for-wards in a straight line rather than having therear end skidding to one side, resulting in pos-sible complete loss of control over the car. Thisis why it is important for the rear wheels neverto lose grip before the front wheels.Wheels should be stored lying down or hangingup, and not standing up.Tyres with tread wear indicators\\n\\n07\\n\\n(cid:2)(cid:2)\\n\\nNOTE\\n\\nNOTE\\n\\nDownloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine\\n\\nLocking wheel nutsLocking wheel nuts can be used on both alu-minium and steel rims.

Volvooffers a comprehensive product for the clean-ing and treatment of leather upholstery which,when used in accordance with the instructions,preserves the leather's protective coating.After a period of use the natural appearance ofthe leather will nevertheless emerge, depend-ing more or less on the surface texture of theleather. This is a natural maturing of the leatherand shows that it is a natural product.To achieve best results Volvo recommendscleaning and the application of protectivecream once to four times per year (or more ifnecessary).

The choice of oilhas been made very carefully with regard toservice life, starting characteristics, fuelconsumption and environmental impact.An approved engine oil must be used inorder that the recommended service inter-vals can be applied. Only use a prescribedgrade of oil for both filling and oil change,otherwise you will risk affecting service life,starting characteristics, fuel consumptionand environmental impact.Volvo Car Corporation disclaims all war-ranty liability if engine oil of the prescribedgrade and viscosity is not used.Volvo recommends that oil changes are car-ried out at a workshop - an authorised Volvoworkshop is recommended.\\n\\n11\\n\\nAdverse driving conditionsAdverse driving conditions can lead to abnor-mally high oil temperature or oil consumption.Below are some examples of adverse drivingconditions.Check the oil level more frequently for longjourneys:•towing a caravan or trailer•in mountainous regions•at high speeds•in temperatures colder than -30 °C or hot-ter than +40 °CThe above also apply to shorter driving dis-tances at low temperatures.Choose a fully synthetic engine oil for adversedriving conditions.

The regulations cover the driving cycles for city driving and driving on main roads. - City driving - The measurement starts with cold startingthe engine. The driving is simulated. Driving on main roads - the car is accelerated and braked at speeds between 0-120 km/h. The driving is simulated. - Cars with the D2 engine and 6-speedmanual transmission with Start/Stop are started in 2nd gear. - The value for combined driving, which is reported in the table, is a combination of city driving and driving on main roads, in accordancewith legal requirements. CO2 emissions - the exhaust gases are collected in order to calculate the carbon dioxide emissions during the two driving cycles. These are then analysed and give the valuefor CO2 emissions.\\n\\n11 SpecificationsFuel\\n\\n183\\n\\n11\\n\\nAE85\\n\\n5.8\\n\\n134\\n\\n106\\n\\n154',\n",
